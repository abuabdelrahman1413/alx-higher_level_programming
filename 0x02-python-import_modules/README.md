0x02 - Python - import & modules

This project focuses on introducing you to importing functions and modules in Python.

Learning Objectives:

    Understand the benefits of Python programming.
    Import functions from another file.
    Utilize imported functions within your code.
    Create a Python module.
    Employ the built-in dir() function.
    Prevent code execution when imported as a module.
    Work with command-line arguments in your Python programs.

Resources:

    Read or watch materials on:
        Modules
        Command line arguments
        pycodestyle - Python code style guide
        man or help commands for:
            python3

Tasks:

    Import a simple function: Write a program that imports the function def add(a, b): from add_0.py and prints the result of the addition (1 + 2 = 3).
    My first toolbox!: Create a program that imports functions from calculator_1.py to perform calculations and print the results. Use variables a and b to store values and avoid exceeding four print statements.
    How to make a script dynamic!: Write a program that displays the number of arguments passed and a list of those arguments.
    Infinite addition: Develop a program that calculates and prints the sum of all provided arguments (assuming they can be converted to integers). Handle large numbers.
    Who are you?: Write a program that retrieves and prints all names defined within the compiled module hidden_4.pyc in alphabetical order, excluding names starting with __.
    Everything can be imported: Create a program that imports the variable a from variable_load_5.py and prints its value.

Requirements:

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, or emacs
    Code execution and compilation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
    All files must end with a new line.
    The first line of each file should be #!/usr/bin/python3
    Include a README.md file in the project's root directory.
    Adhere to pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) guidelines.
    Ensure all files are executable.
    File length will be checked using wc.

Copying and plagiarism are strictly prohibited. You are expected to develop solutions for the tasks independently.

    My first toolbox!: Develop a program that imports functions from calculator_1.py to perform calculations and print the results. Utilize variables a and b to store values, and limit yourself to four print statements.
    How to make a script dynamic!: Write a program that outputs the number of arguments passed and a list of those arguments.
    Infinite addition: Design a program that calculates and prints the sum of all provided arguments (assuming they can be converted to integers). Ensure it can handle large numbers.
