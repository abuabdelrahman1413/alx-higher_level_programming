0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

This project explores fundamental data structures in Python: lists and tuples.
Project Description

    Lists are mutable, ordered sequences of elements. They can store elements of various data types and can be dynamically modified.
    Tuples are immutable, ordered sequences of elements. They resemble lists but cannot be changed after creation.

This project implements exercises to solidify your understanding of these data structures.
Learning Objectives

By working on this project, you will:

    Grasp the creation and manipulation of lists in Python.
    Understand how to access and modify elements within lists.
    Explore common list operations like slicing, concatenation, and iteration.
    Recognize the use cases and properties of immutable tuples.
    Practice working with different data types within lists and tuples.

Prerequisites

A basic understanding of Python programming is recommended. This includes familiarity with variables, data types, operators, and control flow statements.
